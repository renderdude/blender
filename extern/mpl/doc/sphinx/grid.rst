Grids
=====

Global and local grids are two data structures included into MPL to facilitate the implementation of domain decomposition mathods on regular rectangular multidimensional grids.  See sections :doc:`examples/distributed_grid`, :doc:`examples/distributed_grid_scatter_gather`, :doc:`examples/heat_equation_Jacobi_method` and :doc:`examples/heat_equation_successive_over-relaxation` for examples.

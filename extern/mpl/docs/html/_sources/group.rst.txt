Group
=====

Overview
--------

A group is an ordered set of process identifiers. Each process in a group is associated with an integer rank. Ranks are contiguous and start from zero. Groups are represented by ``mpl::group`` objects. A group is used within a communicator to describe the participants in a communication “universe” and to rank such participants.
